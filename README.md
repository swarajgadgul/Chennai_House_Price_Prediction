# Chennai_House_Price_Prediction

## Problem Statement
Real estate transactions are quite opaque sometimes and it
may be difficult for a newbie to know the fair price of any given
home. Thus, multiple real estate websites have the functionality
to predict the prices of houses given different features
regarding it. Such forecasting models will help buyers to identify
a fair price for the home and also give insights to sellers as to
how to build homes that fetch them more money. Chennai
house sale price data is shared here and the participants are
expected to build a sale price prediction model that will aid the
customers to find a fair price for their homes and also help the
sellers understand what factors are fetching more money
for the house.
